            <h2>1. Project details</h2>
            <p>The app was created as a tutoring guide into the 3d design. Because 3D design can be quite complex a lot of people tend to avoid it. UrThree3d solves that issue allowing you to choose the type of lesson depending on your level of knowledge,
                you can either start from 0 if youre a beginner or explore new interesting projects if youre already familiar with 3D.The program that we are gonna use is Blender, not only because its FREE but also because it has everything we need to
                get started,from modeling to texturing</p>
        </section>
        <section id="introduction" role="doc-introduction">
            <h2>2. Introduction</h2>
            <p>I have created UrThreeD because i always heard a lot of designers complain that 3D is hard to pick up because they dont know where to begin. So i decided to study a little bit the market for webapps that can teach you 3D and because i wasnt
                really satisfied with what I felt like I wanted to create my own.</p>

        <section id="structure" role="doc-structure">
            <h2>4.The Interface</h2>
            <p>The easiest way to navigate through the website is using the navbar that will stay on top at all times so the user can always use it.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="structure__landing" role="doc-structure">
            <h3>4.1. Landing Page</h3>
            <p>In this page we will present to the user what he can learn on our platform, all the illustrative images are actually 3d models that the user can recreate using our tutorials, there are special buttons with a lightbulb on it that will send
                the user to that class.</p>

        </section>
        <section id="structure__myacc_logged" role="doc-structure">
            <h4>4.2.1. Login </h4>
            <p>This page will help the user to login into his account so he can see his classes already finished projects and textures used. He can also sign up from the same page if the user doesnt have an account.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="structure__announceslist" role="doc-structure">
            <h3>4.3. Models Page</h3>
            <p>This page is where the user can search for classes and just look at models.Each model has a time period that might be required to complete and also a difficulty level, so the user can pick for himself the class and the model that he feel is
                suited for himself.The filter option also allows the user to select the difficulty of the classes or how popular they are by how many other users have completed the same class.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="structure__announce" role="doc-structure">
            <h3>4.4. Textures Page</h3>
            <p>The textures page works the same way as the Models page only now we are working with different materials. Here the user can learn and use different textures for his models, these are also categorized by time and dificulty.
            </p>

            <h3>5.1. A user wants to learn 3d by enetering on our page.</h3>
            <p>Here the user can choose to c reate an account or just eneter right on the classes.From there her can pick one of the many classes by dificulty, because he doesnt have an account so not a history on our page he will be instructed to start
                with the easier ones but he has the liberty to start with any of them. If he has an account and he logs in he can see the history of the classes that he already finished and can pick another one from the recomandations or just look at
                his finished models.</a>.</p>

        <section id="use-cases__newannounce" role="doc-structure">
            <h3>5.2. An experienced user wants to learn something new.</h3>
            <p>He doesnt need to log in if he just wants to learn a few new things. He can start directly with the high difficulty classes and if he wants more he can create an account that will save his progress and recommend new lessons based on what he
                learned from that lesson.</a>.</p>
